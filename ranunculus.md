1. Plants aquatic, occasionally stranded; leaves submersed, divided into numerous filitorm or attenuate segments or flabelliform in stranded forms. 
  2. Petals white; leaf segments filiform, mostly 0.1-0.2 mm wide, essentially the same width throughout their length | Ranunculus longirostris 
  2. Petals yellow; larger leaf segments wider, often tapered or with attenuate tips. 
    Petals more than 7 mm long; fruiting heads more than 6 mm long; achene bodies soon exceeding 1.6 mm long, without white, corky thickening along the margin and at the base | Ranunculus flabellaris
    Petals less than 7 mm long; fruiting heads up to 6 mm long; achene bodies less than 1.6 mm long, without white corky thickening | Ranunculus gmelinii hookeri
1. Plants terrestrial or subaquatic but with primary leaves emergent; leaves never filiform nor divided into attenuate segments. 
  3. Plants glabrous throughout or essentially so, rarely somewhat ciliate along the distal petioles.
    4. All leaves unlobed, entire to remotely serrate. 
      Basal leaves ovate or oblong; cauline leaves less than 6 cm long; annual | Ranunculus pusillus 
      Basal leaves narrowly lanceolate to linear; larger cauline leaves more than 6 cm long; perennial | Ranunculus ambigens 
    4. At least the distal leaves and bracts deeply lobed or divided, the margins various. 
      5. Petals more than 5 mm long; achenes strongly ﬂattened and rim-margined; stems sarmentose | Ranunculus septentrionalis
      5. Petals less than 5 mm long; achenes turgid, not rim-margined; stems not becoming sarmentose.
        Basal and proximal leaves normally deeply lobed or cleft, the divisions entire to irregularly and shallowly incised | Ranunculus sceleratus
        Basal leaves evenly crenulate, undivided (though rarely with one divided or lobed), quite different from the deeply cleft or divided distal cauline and bracteal leaves | Ranunculus abortivus 
  3. At least the distal portion of plant pubescent, strigose, or pilose to hispid, the leaves usually pubescent, at least along the veins abaxmlly. 
    6. Basal leaves crenulate, ovate, usually unlobed, unlike the deeply divided distal cauline and bracteal leaves | Ranunculus rhomboideus
    6. All leaves deeply cleft or divided. 
      7. Primary leaves simple, very deeply divided or cleft, but with the terminal lobe without a narrow petiolule or stalk; receptacle glabrous or villous. 
        Petals less than 6 mm long, about equaling the sepals; beak of achene strongly recurved; major leaf divisions crenate-denticulate to cleft less than 1/2 their length; receptacle villous | Ranunculus recurvatus 
        Petals more than 6 mm long, much longer than the sepals; beak of achene straight or only slightly bent; leaf divisions dentate, normally cleft much more than 1/2 their length; receptacle glabrous or rarely with villous hairs only at the tip | Ranunculus acris
      7. Primary leaves compound, at least the terminal lobe (major division) petiolulate, with a slender stalk or stipe; receptacle always villous. 
        8. Petals less than 5 mm long, shorter than to subequal to the sepals; mature fruiting heads short—cylindric, obviously longer than broad | Ranunculus pensylvanicus
        8. Petals 5 mm or more long, exceeding the sepals; mature fruiting head subglobose. 
          9. Style and beak inconspicuous, broad-based, and very short, up to 1(1.4)mm long; outline of the blade portion of the leaf seldom exceeding 5 cm in length. 
            10. Base of stem bulbous; sepals soon sharply reﬂexed | Ranunculus bulliosus 
            10. Base of stem not bulbous; sepals reflexed or not.  
              11. Stems erect; sepals reflexed; achenes usually papillose | Ranunculus sardous
              11. Some of the stems usually arching and sarmentose; sepals spreading; achenes smooth. Petals 5-9 | Ranmiculus repens
                Petals more than 9 | Ranunculus repens pleniﬂoms 
          9. Style and beak slender, soon exceeding 1 mm in length; blade length various. 
            12. Stems glabrate to appressed-pubescent or canescent with antrorse hairs.
              Many of the roots tuberous—thickened; plants less than 3 dm high, the stems densely silky pubescent | Ranunculus fascicularis
              Roots without tuberous thickening; plants soon more than 3 dm high, the stems glabrate or finely appresscd- pubescent | Ranunculus septentrionalis
            12. Stems spreading or retrorsely villous or hispid.
              Aerial shoots to 5.5 dm at fruiting timee, all ereect, without a tendency to produce sarmentose branches | Ranunculus hispidus
              Longer aerial shoots at fruiting time more than 5.5 dm long, some of them becoming sarmentose | Ranunculus caricetorum
